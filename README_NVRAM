Please consult "murata-master" sub-folder for module-specific NVRAM file (NVRAM filename includes Murata module designation). 
Note that the FMAC driver loads a specific NVRAM filename when coming up: "brcmfmac"+<CYW number>+<-sdio or -pcie>+".txt"
This means that for any Murata modules which share the same chipset, we can only have one NVRAM file present in the default folder: "/lib/firmware/brcm".
The following module NVRAM default files are included in this folder: 

Cypress Chipset		Default		Options		Notes		
=============		=======		=======		=====
